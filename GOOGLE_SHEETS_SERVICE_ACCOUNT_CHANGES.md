# Google Sheets Service Account Implementation Changes

This document summarizes the changes made to implement Google Sheets integration using Service Account authentication, matching the approach used in the "bot pek" project.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Google Sheets Integration (src/googlesheets.js)

#### Authentication Method
- Replaced API key authentication with Service Account JWT authentication
- Using `google.auth.JWT` for authentication instead of `google.auth.GoogleAuth`
- Service account credentials loaded directly from JSON file

#### File System Operations
- Changed from `fs` to `fs/promises` for better async handling
- Added `hasServiceAccount()` method to check if service account file exists

#### Connection Management
- Added `testConnection()` method to verify Google Sheets connectivity
- Improved error handling and logging

#### Data Structure
- Updated the feedback sheet structure to include an additional column for approved answers
- Range updated from `A:D` to `A:E` for feedback sheet

#### Default Service Account Path
- Set default service account path to `./config/service-account-key.json` to match existing file location

### 2. Updated Configuration (settings.txt)

#### New Setting
- Added `googleSheetsServiceAccountPath` setting with default value `./config/service-account-key.json`
- This matches the "bot pek" approach of using a fixed path for the service account file

#### Default Values
- Set default service account path to `./config/service-account-key.json` instead of requiring a full path

### 3. Updated Documentation

#### Documentation Updates
- Updated `GOOGLE_SHEETS_SERVICE_ACCOUNT.md` with correct service account file path
- Updated `GOOGLE_SHEETS_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CHANGES.md` to document changes made

## Key Improvements

### Security
- Service Account authentication is more secure than API keys
- Credentials are stored in a separate JSON file rather than in settings
- Better access control through Google Cloud IAM

### Reliability
- JWT authentication is more stable than API key authentication
- Better error handling and connection testing
- Improved logging for troubleshooting

### Usability
- Simplified setup with fixed file path for service account credentials
- Clear documentation for users
- Automatic sheet sharing validation

## Implementation Details

### Authentication Flow
1. Service account JSON file is loaded from `./config/service-account-key.json`
2. JWT client is created using service account credentials
3. Google Sheets API client is initialized with JWT authentication
4. All API calls are made using the authenticated client

### Error Handling
- Added comprehensive error handling for file operations
- Improved error messages for common issues
- Added connection testing capability

### Backward Compatibility
- Maintained existing API for the GoogleSheetsFAQ class
- Preserved all existing functionality
- Only changed the authentication method internally

## Migration from API Key Authentication

If you were previously using API key authentication, you'll need to:

1. Create a Google Cloud project and service account
2. Download the service account JSON file
3. Rename it to `service-account-key.json`
4. Place it in the `config` directory of your project
5. Share your Google Sheet with the service account email
6. Remove the `googleSheetsApiKey` setting from settings.txt (no longer used)

The rest of your configuration remains the same.

## Using the Existing Service Account File

If you already have a service account file in the `config` directory named `service-account-key.json`, you don't need to make any changes. The system will automatically use this file for authentication.

To verify the setup:
1. Ensure your Google Sheet is shared with the service account email (found in the JSON file)
2. Verify the `googleSheetsId` in settings.txt matches your Google Sheet ID
3. Test the connection by running the application and checking the logs
