## 🔄 **Feedback System for Complex Questions**

The bot can save complex questions and AI responses to a Google Sheets table for later analysis and approval. This allows:

3. Gradually improving the FAQ base based on real customer questions

To enable this feature:
1. Ensure Google Sheets integration is enabled and configured
2. Make sure the service account has editor permissions on your spreadsheet
3. Use the Telegram bot to manage responses:
   - Navigate to "📊 Управление обратной связью 📊"
   - "📋 Просмотреть ожидающие ответы 📋" - View pending responses
   - "✅ Одобрить ответ" - Approve AI response (you'll be prompted to enter a refined answer)
   - "❌ Отклонить ответ" - Reject AI response and provide a new variant
